# compare-and-save
Compare the prices of the products you want to buy in different stores.

The button that is always at the bottom right is used to create a new container that refers to a new store. When pressing the button, a text input appears where the name of said store must be placed and a button to confirm the name. Finally, two new buttons are added: the first to add a new product, and the second to delete the store. When adding a new product, a text input (for the product name) and a numeric input (for the product price) are created along with the button to confirm the information. You can create as many stores and products as you want. The container titled "Results" contains the stores whose total is, among all stores, the lowest price (best price) and the highest price (worst price), respectively. In addition to a drop-down where the products are filtered by the best price, along with the store where said product was registered.
